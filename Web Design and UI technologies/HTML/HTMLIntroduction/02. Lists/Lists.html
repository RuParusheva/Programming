    <h1>3 Mind-Bending Sci-Fi Advancements In Brain Science:</h1>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Creating Artificial Memories
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Is it possible to artificially create an entirely fake memory that is virtually indistinguishable from a real one? Yes, it is—if you’re one of the researcher at UC Irvine.</li>
                <li>In a study on rats, these researchers managed to introduce new, targeted memories into the rodents’ brains. They played a specific tone to which they wanted the rats to respond, while simultaneously releasing acetylcholine—a chemical responsible for the formation of new memories.</li>
                <li>The result? Rats developed the expected response to that particular tone, when tested the day after the experiment. These new memories had “the same features” as their naturally-occurring counterparts. Furthermore, the artificial memories were retained in the long run, proving that it is possible to permanently shape memories under lab conditions.</li>
                <li>The researchers hope that these findings pave way for helping people with memory and learning disabilities, potentially by introducing new memories using similar accelerated techniques. We’re probably still some way from a future where we acquire new knowledge on demand, like the protagonists in The Matrix—but one can always dream.</li>

        <li>Hacking Brains To Access Sensitive Data
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Everyone knows that our digital devices are prone to hacker attacks. Tech-savvy people can access your credit card information and PIN codes with relative ease, especially if most of your passwords are literally “password.” The best way to keep sensitive data private is to store it safely in the unhackable fortress that is your brain. That way, nobody could possibly gain access to the information, right?</li>
                <li>Not quite.
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>At the USENIX Security Conference 2012, researchers have demonstrated how information can be made easier to extract using simple, off-the-shelf devices.</li>
                        <li>For their demonstration,
                            <ul type="square">
                                <li>they used a relatively inexpensive,</li> 
                                <li>readily available brain–computer</li>
                                <li>interface (BCI) and their own mind-reading program. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Participants were analyzed without being explicitly told that their brain would be “hacked” in the process.</li>
                    </ul>     
                </li>
                <li>By reading the electroencephalography (EEG) signals produced by the subjects’ brains, researchers were able to prove that access to private information—PIN codes, credit card data, and so on—can be made measurably easier via consumer-grade BCI devices. While not making such information fully transparent, “the entropy of the private information is decreased on the average by approximately 15 to 40 percent compared to random guessing attacks,” when using BCI.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Mind Control
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>As curious as the above studies are, perhaps none of them come as close to the realm of science fiction as mind control—one of the most explored “what ifs” in many movies and books. While true mind control isn’t exactly on the horizon, a few recent studies have yielded some pretty extraordinary results.</li>
                <li>In a Harvard Medical School study, humans were able to directly control movements of a rat’s tail using thoughts alone. Human subjects were fitted with a BCI device that converted their thoughts into computer commands. The rats, in turn, were outfitted with a computer-to-brain interface that used focused ultrasound to stimulate their brains.</li>
                <li>As a result, a brain-to-brain connection opened between the humans and the rats, allowing humans to remotely control the rats’ tails at will. The study had an astonishing 94 percent success rate, across six different humans and six different rats. Notably, the established brain-to-brain connection was entirely noninvasive, requiring no complex surgical procedures.</li>
                <li>If you think that’s impressive, wait until we tell you about a recent study at the University of Washington. This study used similar brain-to-brain communication, with one noteworthy difference: Both subjects were human.</li>
