Computers, software and the modern world
Nowadays computers have become irreplaceable. We use them to solve complex problems at the workplace, seek driving directions, have fun and communicate. They have countless applications in all areas of existence – economics and finance, entertainment, telecommunications, medicine and education among others. We won’t be exaggerating in our statement that computers form the neural system of contemporary society and it is difficult to imagine our existence without them.
Despite the fact that computers are so widespread, few people know how they actually operate. In reality, it is not the computers, but the programs, running on the designated configuration that matter. It is the software that makes computers valuable to the end-user, allowing for variety of services that change and facilitate our lives.
How Do Computers Process Information?
In order to understand what programming means, we will compare a computer and its operating system to a large factory with all its workshops, warehouses and transportation systems. This rough analogy makes it easier to picture the level of complexity modern computers incorporate. There are many processes running on a computer, which can be compared to the workshops and production lines in a factory. The hard drive, stored data, and the operating memory (RAM) match the characteristics of warehouses, and the different protocols resemble transportation systems, which facilitate the information flow.
In general, individual components, which form the end product, are produced separately and originate from different manufacturing units. They are assembled from raw materials stacked at the warehouses. The warehouses also serve as storage facilities for the finished product. Raw materials are provisioned by suppliers and the production is transferred from the warehouses to the outlets. To accomplish this, different types of transportation is used. Raw materials enter the factory, undergo different processing stages and leave the factory as goods ready for sale and consumption. 
The computer is an information processing machine. Unlike the factory we used as an example, computers perceive information both as input (raw materials) and output (end product). Usually the input is taken from any of the warehouses (files or RAM), where it has been stored as a result of previous transports. Subsequently, it is transformed by one or more processes, resulting in completely new product. Web based applications are a good example of this behavior. If we apply the previous analogy they use HTTP to transfer raw materials and products, while information processing usually is associated with extracting content from a database and preparing it for visualization in the form of HTML.
Managing computers 
The manufacturing process is governed by several management levels. Machines and assembly lines are handled by operators, managers oversee the workshops and the factory as a whole is run by directors. Each role controls different aspect of the process. Machine handlers operate on the lowest level – they control the machines with buttons and levers. Middle level is reserved for the workshop managers. On executive level, directors manage all aspects of factory operation. They do that by issuing orders and performing planning and coordination functions.
Identically, computers and software also have many management and control layers. The lowest is handled by the processor and its registries (this is accomplished by using machine programs at low level). The variety of responsibilities the operating system incorporates (Windows 7 for example), like the file system, peripheral devices, users and communication protocols, are controlled at middle level – similar to the management of the different workshops and departments in the factory. At the highest level, we have application software. It runs a whole ensemble of processes, which consume enormous amount of processor operations. This is the top management level, where executives run the whole factory in order to maximize utilization of the resources and ensure production quality.
The Essence of Programming
The essence of programming is to control what the computer does on all levels. This can be accomplished through usage of commands issued by the programmer, which are also known as programming instructions. Programming means organizing the work of the computer through sequence of instructions. Those are given in writing and are implicitly followed by the computer (respectively by the operating system, the CPU and the peripheral devices).
